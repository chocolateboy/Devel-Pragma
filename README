Devel::Hints::Lexical version 0.06
================================

Devel::Hints::Lexical exports a function that makes %^H lexically-scoped.

Until perl change #33311, which isn't currently available in any stable perl release, %^H is dynamically scoped,
rather than lexically-scoped. This means that values set in %^H are visible in modules loaded by C<use>.
This makes pragmas leak from the scope in which they're meant to be enabled to scopes in which they're
not. This module fixes that by making %^H lexically scoped i.e. it prevents %^H leaking across file boundaries.
