=head1 NAME

Devel::Pragma - helper functions for developers of lexical pragmas

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyPragma;

    use Devel::Pragma qw(:all);

    sub import {
        my ($class, %options) = @_;
        my $hints  = hints;        # the builtin (%^H) used to implement lexical pragmas
        my $caller = ccstash();    # the name of the currently-compiling package (stash)

        unless ($hints->{MyPragma}) { # top-level
            $hints->{MyPragma} = 1;
        }

        if (new_scope($class)) {
            ...
        }

        my $scope_id = scope();
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides helper functions for developers of lexical pragmas (and a few functions that may
be useful to non-pragma developers as well).

Pragmas can be used both in older versions of perl (from 5.8.1), which had limited support, and in
the most recent versions, which have improved support.

=head1 EXPORTS

Devel::Pragma exports the following functions on demand. They can all be imported at once by using
the C<:all> tag. e.g.

    use Devel::Pragma qw(:all);

=head2 ccstash

Returns the name of the currently-compiling package (stash). It only works inside code that's being C<required>,
either in a C<BEGIN> block via C<use> or at runtime. In practice, its use should be restricted to compile-time i.e.
C<import> methods and any other methods/functions that can be traced back to C<import>.

When called from code that isn't being C<require>d, it returns undef.

It can be used as a replacement for the scalar form of C<caller> to provide the name of the package in which
C<use MyPragma> is called. Unlike C<caller>, it returns the same value regardless of the number of
intervening calls before C<MyPragma::import> is reached.

    package Caller;

    use Callee;

    package Callee;

    use Devel::Pragma qw(ccstash);

    sub import {
        A();
    }

    sub A() {
        B();
    }

    sub B {
        C();
    }

    sub C {
        say ccstash; # Caller
    }

=head2 fqname

Takes a subroutine name and an optional caller (package name). If no caller is supplied, it defaults
to L<"ccstash">, which requires C<fqname> to be called from C<import> (or a function/method that can
be traced back to C<import>).

It returns the supplied name in package-qualified form. In addition, old-style C<'> separators are
converted to new-style C<::>.

If the name contains no separators, then the C<caller>/C<ccstash> package name is prepended.
If the name is already package-qualified, it is returned unchanged.

In list context, C<fqname> returns the package and unqualified subroutine name (e.g. "Foo::Bar" and "baz"),
and in scalar context it returns the package and sub name joined by "::" (e.g. "Foo::Bar::baz"). e.g.

    package MyPragma::Loader;

    use MyPragma (\&coderef, 'foo', 'MyPragmaLoader::bar');

    package MyPragma;

    sub import {
        my ($class, @listeners) = @_;
        my @subs;

        for my $listener (@listeners) {
            push @subs, handle_sub($listener);
        }
    }

    sub handle_sub {
        my $sub = shift

        if (ref($ub) eq 'CODE') {
            return $sub;
        } else {
            handle_name($sub);
        }
    }

    sub handle_name {
        my ($package, $name) = fqname($name); # uses ccstash e.g. foo -> MyPragma::Loader::foo
        my $sub = $package->can($name);
        die "no such sub: $package\::$name" unless ($sub);
        return $sub;
    }

=head2 hints

This function enables the scoped behaviour of the hints hash (C<%^H>) and then returns a reference to it.

The hints hash is a compile-time global variable (which is also available at runtime in recent perls) that
can be used to implement lexically-scoped features and pragmas. This function provides a convenient
way to access this hash without the need to perform the bit-twiddling that enables it on older perls.
In addition, this module loads L<Lexical::SealRequireHints>, which implements bugfixes
that are required for the correct operation of the hints hash on older perls (< 5.12.0).

Typically, C<hints> should be called from a pragma's C<import> (and optionally C<unimport>) method:

    package MyPragma;

    use Devel::Pragma qw(hints);

    sub import {
        my $class = shift;
        my $hints = hints;

        if ($hints->{MyPragma}) {
            # ...
        } else {
            $hints->{MyPragma} = ...;
        }

        # ...
    }

=head2 new_scope

This function returns true if the currently-compiling scope differs from the scope being compiled the last
time C<new_scope> was called. Subsequent calls will return false while the same scope is being compiled.

C<new_scope> takes an optional parameter that is used to uniquely identify its caller. This should usually be
supplied as the pragma's class name unless C<new_scope> is called by a module that is not intended
to be subclassed. e.g.

    package MyPragma;

    sub import {
        my ($class, %options) = @_;

        if (new_scope($class)) {
            ...
        }
    }

If not supplied, the identifier defaults to the name of the calling package.

=head2 scope

This returns an integer that uniquely identifies the currently-compiling scope. It can be used to
distinguish or compare scopes.

A warning is issued if C<scope> (or C<new_scope>) is called in a context in which it doesn't make sense i.e. if the
scoped behaviour of C<%^H> has not been enabled - either by explicitly modifying C<$^H>, or by calling
L<"hints">.
